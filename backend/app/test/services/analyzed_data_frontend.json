We've never come across an all-inclusive experience of this caliber in Sri Lanka. \n\nFrom the romantic cabins with extra-long beds to the wide, luxurious sunbeds on the private beach, every detail of our stay was designed for comfort and indulgence.

    "text": "Gorgeous beach villa stay, a welcomed break from the hostel life. I had the pleasure of spending a night at one of Ella’s best-known hostels, Tomorrowland, where I met the owner. During our conversation, he suggested that if I was planning to visit the southern beaches, I should consider staying at their brand-new beach property—Tomorrowland Beach Villas in Rekawa, Tangalle.\nAlthough I had already booked accommodations in Mirissa, I decided to take a chance and spend a night at Tomorrowland Beach Villas before heading to my final destination—Kandy. Upon arrival, I was warmly welcomed by the lovely hosts, Irushi and Hiruni, making it one of the most heartfelt greetings I’ve received at a property in Sri Lanka. I was given the Winter Villa, a stunning all-wood cabin perched right at the water’s edge, where the waves crashed just below.\nFor dinner, I indulged in one of Tomorrowland’s specialties—the Pompano Fish, part of an impressive selection of freshly caught seafood. Dining at sunset, right where the waves met the shore, was nothing short of sublime. Adding to the charm, a breakwater runs perpendicular to Tomorrowland’s private beach. The right side forms a serene, blue-water pool, where I enjoyed a leisurely soak until sundown.\nAlthough Tomorrowland had arranged an early morning bird-watching lagoon cruise, I ended up sleeping in until 9:00 AM—unfortunately missing the adventure, as I had to rush to catch my transportation to Kandy.\nTomorrowland Beach Villas is a paradise for couples who cherish privacy, romance, and a touch of indulgence. I will definitely be returning with my partner next time—and with a few well-earned credits from Tomorrowland Properties, it’s sure to be even more memorable. Five stars all the way!Genuinely everything was amazing. Wouldn’t change a thing :)",

Отдельное спасибо хозяину отеля Удея и его помощницам, за их гостеприимство и душевную атмосферу, юмор и понимание. Пляж находится буквально в пару метров от отеля, песчаный берег, есть заграждение от волн, и было комфортно и безопасно купаться. Шезлонги широкие и комфортные. Уборка в доме проводилась каждый день. Из гостей были только мы и ощутили полное уединение. Каждый день нас баловали местными национальными блюдами, все очень было вкусно и необычно. Больше всего понравились карри и жареные креветки. В день прибытия мы праздновали день рождения, персонал поздравил великолепным тортом и шариками. Также нам организовали две экскурсии: прогулку на каноэ по реке Рекава и поездку к черепахам. Мы отлично отдохнули и зарядились только положительными эмоциями. Рекомендуем отель тем, кто ищет релакс и тишину, засыпать и просыпаться под шум волны с чудесными видами прям из окна небольшого, но уютного бунгало.Все понравилось.",
