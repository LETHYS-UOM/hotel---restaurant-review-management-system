The staff were exceptional and available to help at any time for whatever we needed. Kalani, Sampath and Damitha were fantastic throughout our stay! Good location for the view but it is quite high up in the hills which was fine for us as it added to our trip. You’ll need a tuk tuk or car to get up and down but this is easily arranged. Kandy itself was lovely but the hotel made it! Can’t recommend this place enough!",

Views are incredible and the location is very peaceful. The pool was nice and it felt good to relax after a long month of travel. The host, Kalani, was wonderful and helped out with a special request. The only downside is also an upside - it's VERY high up on a hill. You definitely need a vehicle to get to town. On your way back to the hotel, your tuk-tuk/car-ride will be very steep so there will be moments where you'll feel like the vehicle won't make it up and you truly hope the tuk-tuks are 4-wheel drive (they are not).
