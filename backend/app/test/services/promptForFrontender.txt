Role: You are a Review Data Processor and Sentiment Analyst for a hotel reputation management system.

Task: I will provide you with a JSON array of raw hotel reviews. Your job is to parse, clean, and restructure this data into a specific JSON output format.

Transformation Rules:

id: Use the original review_id.

rating: The input score is out of 10. Convert this to a 1-5 star rating scale (e.g., score / 2). Round to the nearest integer.

userName: The input does not have a specific name field. You must extract the name from the raw_review field. The name is typically the very first word or two at the start of that string (e.g., if raw_review is "Prem IndiaDouble Room...", the name is "Prem").

text: Combine the title, positive_txt, and negative_txt into a single, coherent paragraph. Do not include empty strings if the positive or negative text is missing.

sentiment: Analyze the combined text and the score. Output one of the following: "Positive", "Neutral", "Negative".

categories: Analyze the text and tag the review with relevant categories from this list: ["Cleanliness", "Staff", "Location", "Facilities", "Comfort", "Value", "Noise", "Food", "Privacy"]. Max 3 categories.

source: Always set this to "Booking.com".

date: Format the reviewer_stay_date into "MMM DD, YYYY" format (e.g., "Sep 01, 2025").

status: Always set this to "Pending".

Это был лучший отель по всем параметрам. Красивый интерьер, очень чисто - убираются тщательно, даже в лобби при мне пылесосили подушки дивана с двух сторон, современная сантехника, кофемашина в номере, мощный фен. Большое внимание уделено деталям, каждый день свежие цветы в ресторане, красивая, стильная посуда. Персонал очень внимательный и вежливый, помогает в любых вопросах. В ресторане вкусная еда и хорошее вино. Особенная благодарность господину Амила, за его внимание и помощь. Очень душевное место, которое оставило только положительные впечатления. 🩵Show translation1 person found this review helpful.HelpfulNot helpful", "photo": [{"src": "https://r-xx.bstatic.com/xdata/images/xphoto/max1280x900/610780182.jpg?k=f578dd8c213b258f5b651506563fec76996e2303c27d81751e028da70c678bb8&o=", "alt": "Drinks at NiiRA"}, {"src": "https://q-xx.bstatic.com/xdata/images/xphoto/max1280x900/610780185.jpg?k=91a377dcaca8a260eeb33ce6a37303252ca2c83c6a07303a5e9804fbea921d0a&o=", "alt": "Food at or somewhere near the hotel"}, {"src": "https://q-xx.bstatic.com/xdata/images/xphoto/max1280x900/610780205.jpg?k=84f259e1bfd08cd77a6a4d364ce41dac1b3afbaff180f40014ffb4d4a4a4176a&o=", "alt": "A seating area at NiiRA"}, {"src": "https://q-xx.bstatic.com/xdata/images/xphoto/max1280x900/610780277.jpg?k=0bed6aadf8388077e4ce124de44715eefdc4c44d1cb24bf4853719863d94f13d&o=", "alt": "Food at or somewhere near the hotel"}]}, {"review_id": 38, "title": "Zentral gelegene & sehr schöne Unterkunft mit europäischen Standards.", "score": 9.0, "positive_txt": "Alles!
