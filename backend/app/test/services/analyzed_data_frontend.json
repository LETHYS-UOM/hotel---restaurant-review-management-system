The staff was the most friendly I've ever encountered, they went above and beyond on service to make us feel good. Super close to the beach, rooms were amazing and food for dinner was the main highlight. You must try the local food there, probably the best we had throughout our days in Mirissa. Only 2 downsides to the stay so you are aware: - The hotel is located on a hill so expect to walk up when coming back from the beach. Would be great if they improved the road on the way or something similar to make the way up easier - The staff still feels quite new to the role (it's a new hotel) so expect some delays on food and service isn't still at the same level as the hotel itself. But they are always super willing and friendly which makes up for any out of sync issues",

    "text": "A Perfect Stay at Niira. We had such a great time at Niira — honestly one of the best stays of our entire trip in Mirissa. The property is beautifully designed, modern, and luxurious, with thoughtful touches in every room that make the experience feel special. The hospitality was the biggest highlight. Everyone—from the owners to the managers to the staff—was warm and genuinely invested in making our stay comfortable. A special shout-out to Chatur, who went above and beyond to take care of us throughout and made our anniversary feel really special. We also loved the variety of welcome drink options, including beer. The terrace restaurant, the café, and the pool area are all incredibly scenic. From the terrace and restaurant you can watch surfers catching waves, and at night you get a beautiful view of the sea. The pool is another standout — not just stunning, but also equipped with a bar where you can order drinks while you relax. It’s honestly one of the nicest places to spend time on the property. Breakfast was fresh and delicious (the English breakfast was perfect), and the location is ideal — just a short walk to Mirissa Beach and the main street with cafés and shops. Overall, Niira stood out for its design, hospitality, and all the small personal touches that made our stay memorable. Highly recommend it, and we’d love to come back.",

They personalise every dish like it was ordered from a 5 star restaurant. I travelled with my 1 year old daughter to celebrate her birthday and they were so nice to make special meals for her, cook as per our requirement. They also upgraded our room as a complimentary gesture. Since we are INDIANS and were travelling with my family, they offered us an Indian Dinner at their restaurant which was not there in the menu. The cocktails here are to die for. The staff here is very nice, polite and accommodating. All the chef were amazing. The location is just perfect with 5 mins walking to the beach.
